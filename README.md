# SMBH

## Introduction and Motivation

The mass_luminosity_function is a Python package for calculating the mass-luminosity function of quasars. The mass-luminosity function is an important statistical relationship between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies and the luminosities of the quasars

## Installation

The package is installable on Python 3.x and can be installed using:

```pip install SMBH```

Access the functions by writing:
```Import SMBH.entery```
```import SMBH.classify```

## Description of the functions
```Entery``` function

Take in the input variables redshift, mass, and luminousity.

```Classify``` function

```Mmean``` function

```Bmean``` function
